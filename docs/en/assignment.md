## 1.1 The Local Food Guide

As the Innlandet region becomes more urban, new restaurants are emerging frequently, especially in the heart of Innlandet, in Hamar. By 2024, it is possible to find both good and not-so-good dining experiences throughout the region.

Your task is to develop a simple web application where users can post and view reviews of local restaurants, eateries, and bars that offer some form of service. The application should be accessible via the internet, easy to use, and demonstrate the basic functionality required in modern web applications. Try to put yourself in the shoes of a reviewer or someone reading reviews. Where and when do they do it? How can this be made easily accessible and user-friendly for the end user?

### 1.1.1 Registration/Login

Users should be able to log in to the solution, create an account, and log in. This can be solved in several ways, and you are encouraged to discuss your considerations on how to solve this.

### 1.1.2 Creating Eateries

To review an eatery, these must be stored somewhere so that reviews can be linked to them. This part of the task can be solved as simply as possible, and it is not expected that a user interface for creating these will be available. However, consider which information and metadata might be useful to have registered for an eatery to provide the best possible user experience for the end users of the system.

### 1.1.3 Posting Reviews

Authenticated users should be able to post a review. You decide which components should be included in a review (rating, free text, service, etc.). This should be an interface that is accessible via the internet.

### 1.1.4 Viewing Reviews

All visitors to the service should be able to navigate eateries and associated reviews. In this subtask, you are free to choose the technology. Here, it is important to consider the user journey, user experience, and accessibility. As the owner of the application, the idea holder believes that this is key to succeeding with the service and gaining adoption in the market. Thoughts around architecture and the business case will influence your choices here.

## 1.2 General Requirements for the Application

The application should be responsive and provide a good user experience across different devices. Additionally, consider the subject's goal requirements. Ensure to have clean and maintainable code. You are free to choose development tools and languages. Feel free to use the development environments available at your workplace. The application should have good documentation. Discuss why this is important. Make sure to use good working methods in development and argue briefly for your choice (agile/waterfall? How to work with the codebase daily, etc.).

The source code should be accessible to those who need access throughout the project lifecycle.

# 2. Working Methods, Process, and General Information

## 2.1 Project Flow

The development should be carried out as a small project, where you plan user stories, epics, and tasks. The employer has access to Jira, which can be a good alternative.

## 2.2 General

The task consists of four parts: planning, execution, documentation, and self-evaluation. Keywords for these parts can be estimation, security, legal compliance, sustainability, and ethics. Remember that it is not only the technological solution that counts towards a final evaluation. Good self-reflection and documentation also count. Good luck with the task!
