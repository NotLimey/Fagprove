## 1.1 The Local Food Guide

As the Inland region becomes a more urban place, restaurants are popping up like mushrooms, especially in the heart of the Inland area, Hamar. But throughout the region, by 2024, itâ€™s possible to grab a good, and not-so-good, bite to eat everywhere.

Your task is to develop a simple web application where users can add and view reviews of local restaurants, eateries, and bars that offer some form of dining service. The application should be accessible from the internet, easy to use, and demonstrate basic functionality required in modern web applications. Try putting yourself in the shoes of a reviewer or someone reading a review. Where and when do they do it? How can this best be made accessible and palatable for the end user?

### 1.1.1. Registration/Login

It should be possible to log into the solution, and the user should be able to create an account and log in. This can be solved in several ways, feel free to discuss your considerations on how you decide to solve this.

### 1.1.2. Creating Places to Eat

To be able to review a place to eat, they must be stored somewhere that reviews can be linked to. This part of the task can be solved in the simplest way possible at your discretion, and there isn't an expectation for a user interface to create these. However, think about what information and metadata might be useful to have registered for a place to eat to provide the best possible user experience for the system's end users.

### 1.1.3. Adding Reviews

Authenticated users should be able to add a review. You decide the components that make up a review (rating, free text, service, etc.). This should be an interface that is accessible from the internet.

### 1.1.4. Viewing Reviews

All visitors of the service should be able to navigate through places to eat and associated reviews. In this task, you are free to choose the technology. Here it is important to consider the user journey, user experience, and accessibility. As the owner of the application, the idea creator believes this is the key to succeeding with the service and gaining market adoption. Thoughts on architecture and business cases play into your choices here.

## 1.2. General Requirements for the Application

The application should be responsive and provide a good user experience across different devices. Additionally, consider the subject's goal requirements. Ensure that the code is good and maintainable. You are free to choose developer tools and programming languages. Feel free to use the development environments available to you at your workplace. The application should have good documentation. Discuss why this is important. Make sure to use good work methodology in the development and briefly argue for your choice (agile/waterfall? How to work with the codebase daily, etc.).

The source code should be available to those who want access throughout the project.

# 2. Workform, Process and General Information

## 2.1. The Project Process

The development should be done as a small project, where you plan user stories, epics, and tasks. The employer has access to Jira, which could be a good option.

## 2.2. General Information

The task consists of four parts: planning, execution, documentation, and self-assessment. Keywords for these parts can be estimation, security, legal security, sustainability, and ethics. Remember that it is not only the technological solution that counts towards a final evaluation. Good self-reflection and documentation also count. Good luck with the task!
