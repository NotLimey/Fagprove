# My interpretation of the task

I am to create a technical web-based solution that provides an overview of restaurants in the inland region and reviews of them. Users should be able to review restaurants themselves.

The application should demonstrate the basic functionality required in modern web applications. I believe this means I am to highlight my ability to create something within functionalities we take for granted in 2024 on a website, such as responsiveness, universal design, security, backend functionality, and fast performance. Of course, there is more to it than this, but these are some of the basic elements in modern web applications.

I will build the web application with reviewers and users in mind. Trying to put myself in their shoes to see what is important in a review, how easy it is to check a review, and the information that should be available about various restaurants.

The web application should allow for logging in. You should log in to review, but you don't need to log in to read reviews. The task is also open to whether administrators should exist and if they should be able to add restaurants. It is also mentioned that I should consider what information is important for the restaurants.

Users should be able to add reviews, but it is up to me to decide what the criteria for a review should be.

Users should easily be able to find and navigate to eateries and associated reviews. Think business case.

Frameworks and technology are optional.

## 2. Application Requirements

The application should be responsive and provide a good user experience across different devices.
The code should be good and maintainable.
Development tools and languages are optional.
Can use development environments that are available at work/workplace.
The application should be well documented.
Why good documentation is important should be answered. Agile/waterfall?
How does one work with the codebase daily?
The source code should be made public.

The project should be planned, creating user stories, epics, and tasks. The employer recommends Jira, which I choose to use.

## 3. General Information

The task consists of 4 parts: planning, execution, documentation, and self-assessment.
Keywords: estimation, security, legal security, sustainability, and ethics.

## 4. General Thoughts on the Task

I think the task is very straightforward and should be solvable. However, I think there are some pitfalls that are important to be aware of. Especially regarding how much I plan to make and authentication. I think I may overestimate how much I can achieve, and itâ€™s easy to not finish an "MVP".

Authentication is also a point where it is very easy to get stuck and spend too much time. I think I need to sit down and think carefully about how I want to handle authentication.

GDPR also comes to mind immediately, the importance of privacy on this site, given that user information will be shown in reviews.

But I am excited to see how I will tackle this challenge.
