# My Interpretation of the Task
[<- Back](/)

I will create a technical web solution that provides an overview of restaurants in the Innlandet region and reviews of them. Users should be able to review restaurants themselves.

The application should demonstrate the basic functionalities required in modern web applications. What I believe this includes is showing that I can create something that encompasses functionalities that we take for granted on a website in 2024, such as responsiveness, universal design, security, backend functionality, and fast performance. Of course, there is more to it, but these are some of the fundamental aspects of modern web applications.

I will build the web application with reviewers and users in mind. I will try to put myself in their shoes to understand what is important in a review, how easy it is to check a review, and what information should be available about various restaurants.

The web application should support login functionality. You should log in to post a review, but you do not need to log in to read reviews. It is also open in the task whether administrators should exist and whether they should be able to add restaurants. Here too, it is mentioned that I should consider what information is important for the restaurants.

Users should be able to post reviews, but it is up to me what the criteria for a review should be.

Users should easily find and navigate to eateries and associated reviews. Think business case.

Framework and technology are optional.

## 2. Requirements for the Application

The application should be responsive and provide a good user experience across different devices. 
The code should be clean and maintainable.
Developer tools and language are optional.
You can use the development environments available at work.
The application should be well-documented.
Discuss why good documentation is important. Agile/waterfall?
How do you work with the codebase daily?
The source code should be public.

The project should be planned, creating user stories, epics, and tasks. The employer recommends Jira, which I choose to use.

## 3. General

The task consists of 4 parts: planning, execution, documentation, and self-evaluation.
Keywords: estimation, security, legal compliance, sustainability, and ethics.

## 4. General Thoughts on the Task

First and foremost, I think the task is very straightforward and doable. However, I also think there are some pitfalls that are important to be aware of, especially regarding how much I plan to make and authentication. I think I can easily overestimate how much I can do, and then it is easy not to finish an "MVP."

Authentication is also a point where it is very easy to get stuck and spend too much time. I think I need to sit down and think carefully about how I want to handle authentication.

GDPR immediately comes to mind regarding the importance of privacy on this site since user information will be displayed around reviews.

But I am excited to see how I solve this challenge.
